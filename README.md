# Samurat_Python

##  Task-1 Description
A Python program that:
1. Checks if a number is greater than 7 and prints "Hello".
2. Checks if the name entered is "John" and outputs the corresponding message.
3. Processes an array to output elements that are multiples of 3.

## How to Run
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. 1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ethnosqq/Samurat_Python.git
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Example Input/Output
Input:
1. Enter a number: 10
2. Enter a name: John
3. Enter a numeric array (space-separated): 3 6 8 9 10 12 17

Output:
1. Hello
2. Hello, John
3. Elements that are multiples of 3: [3, 6, 9, 12]

## Testing the program
Run the program to check its operation:
1. python main.py

Input example:
1. Enter a number: 74
2. Enter a name: Ben
3. Enter a numeric array (space-separated): 3 6 9 12

Example output:
1. Hello
2. There is no such name
3. Elements that are multiples of 3: [3, 6, 9, 12]

## Task-2

## Bracket Sequence Question
### Given Sequence: `[((())()(())]]`
**Can this sequence be considered correct?**  
No, the sequence is **not correct** because there is an extra closing square bracket `]` without a corresponding opening square bracket `[`.

### How to fix it?
To make the sequence correct, add one opening square bracket `[` at the beginning of the sequence.

**Correct Sequence:** `[[((())()(())]]`
